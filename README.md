# CryptoClustering

For this project, we are attempting to use unsupervized learning to track the price movements of various cryptocurrencies and make predictions for future outlooks. Before we can begin this process, we must first prepare the data we intend to use. We are using StandardScaler to scale our data. We then use the Elbow method to determine the best value for 'k'. Then we will perform PCA to reduce the features used in our model. We will then vizualize both of these results together to see how our data is effected, and then use these vizualizations to analyze our data.
